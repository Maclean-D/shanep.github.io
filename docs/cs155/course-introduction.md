# Course Introduction

The purpose of this class is to get you familiar with version control,
specifically Git. This is a hands-on class that consists of reading
about concepts and then practicing those concepts with walk-through
labs. Git can only be mastered through **lots** of practice, so we will be
doing a lot of labs that involve interacting with existing repositories.
In future classes, you will then start to use Git when working on team
assignments.

Before we get started learning about Git, we need to introduce basic
terminal usage. You will primarily be using the terminal to interact
with Git in this class. While you can do most basic Git operations using
a Graphical User Interface (GUI), advanced operations will require you to
use the terminal. We will leverage the integrated terminal of VSCode to
interact with Git.

## Reading

Reading is expected to take about 3-4 hours. We will be using a free (but well-written) book for this module, which
you can [download here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nJ0XC0H7eI5I_g9WCqY9v-LlBMREaRBe/view?usp=share_link).
Once you have downloaded the book, read the following chapters as well as
the post on the integrated terminal in VSCode before you attempt the
homework section.

- [Chapter 1 - What Is the Shell?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nJ0XC0H7eI5I_g9WCqY9v-LlBMREaRBe/view)
- [Chapter 2 - Navigation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nJ0XC0H7eI5I_g9WCqY9v-LlBMREaRBe/view)
- [Chapter 3 - Exploring the System](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nJ0XC0H7eI5I_g9WCqY9v-LlBMREaRBe/view)
- [Chapter 4 - Manipulating Files and Directories](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nJ0XC0H7eI5I_g9WCqY9v-LlBMREaRBe/view)
- [The History of Version Control](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12A_7HZiZXWAOQ6r3BsGqiiH25CA_WzIi/view?usp=share_link)

## Homework

Homework is expected to take about 3-4 hours. The time commitment in this
module can vary widely because you will be downloading and installing
tools, which can take more time depending on your personal computing
configuration.

- [Sign up for a FREE GitHub student account](https://education.github.com/pack)
- [Install VSCode and Git](https://shanepanter.com/teaching/vscode-tips-and-tricks.html)
- Complete the module reading quiz (Canvas)
- Complete the history of version control essay (Canvas)

Getting a GitHub Student Developer pack requires that you use your
university email address! It may take a few days for GitHub to approve
your account, but donâ€™t worry, you will be able to complete all the labs
with the standard free account. The student account just gives you
access to cool resources that you would normally have to pay for.

## Retrospective - Class Interaction

Retrospectives are expected to take about 2-3 hours. This includes the time
required to create your own video or discussion post and then watch and
read posts from other students and your instructor.

- Complete the module retrospective assignment (Canvas)

Even though this is an online asynchronous course we will still have
interactions with each other in the form of discussion posts or video
interactions. On Canvas you will see a retrospective posted for each
module that will require you to interact (in an asynchronous manner)
with your fellow students and instructors.

A class of 90+ students can produce a **huge** amount of content that is
impossible for one person to consume in a reasonable time frame. For
example, my classes typically have well over 30+ hours of student-produced content **each week**. So as your instructor, it is absolutely
impossible for me to watch every single post in its entirety. I will
select a few posts from each student over the course of the semester to
watch and give feedback on. If you have a question please send a
**direct email** to your instructor as I may not see questions asked in
the middle of a video.
