# HW3 - Create a GitHub Page


In this assignment we are going to shift gears and work with some GitHub services beyond just simple
repository hosting. Github is very popular in the open source community so it is very likely that
you will have to interact with the service at some point in your career.

This assignment will create your own GitHub page so you can showcase any open source work that you
do. This is a great way to build a portfolio so you can land that high paying $$$ job when you
graduate!

1. Watch the [introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NW0hidCdYw)
2. Work through the [hello world](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) tutorial on GitHub.
3. Work through the [getting started with github pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/)tutorial

   **NOTE:** In the step above the file `_config.yml` may not be automatically created. So you will
   have to create it yourself and add it to your repository :)

4. Read the [mastering markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) tutorial
5. Publish your GitHub page!

You can see an example of what you need to submit at: https://bsu-shanepanter.github.io/

::: info

It can take up to 10 - 30 minutes for your GitHub page to be live!  Your page will
not instantly update when published. It is your responsibility to make sure your page publishes
correctly. You will not get credit for submitting a link to your GitHub repo! You must submit a link
to your published GitHub page which should be in the form https://username.github.io

:::

There is no cost to publish a page so you do not need to pay GitHub or any other company money to
complete this assignment!

## Submitting

To get credit for this assignment please submit the URL to your published page to the Canvas
assignment. Your grade will be updated after the due date (and late window) have passed.
