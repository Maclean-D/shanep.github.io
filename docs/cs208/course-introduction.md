# Course Introduction

In this course, we will explore how websites work, their structure, how
information is communicated across the Internet, and how to go about
building websites. Web development consists of a lot of different
technologies that have evolved significantly over the years. Originally
the web was only supposed to enable researchers to share documents in an
easy manner. However, the web has now evolved into a way to develop and
deliver applications in a cross platform environment that is almost on
par with native applications.

What makes web development hard is the vast number of languages,
frameworks, and standards that all somehow fit together to create what
we think of as the "Modern Web". Additionally, web development changes
very rapidly so what is the new hot thing today will be considered
obsolete in a few years. This class doesnâ€™t teach frameworks, this class
teaches the fundamentals that are used to build everything else.

This week gives a very high level overview of all the technologies used
in web development. While you are not expected to be an expert in
everything having a general understanding of the terminology can help
you be a better web developer.
