# Full Stack Introduction

In this module, we will introduce server-side programming. Most websites
and web applications require the development of client-side technologies
that interact with server-side technologies. Client-side (or front-end)
refers to those technologies that run in the web browser like HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript. Server-side (or back-end) refers to those technologies
that run on the web server like Node.js. There are certain things that
you should never do on the client side. For example, accessing a
database (while possible) should never be done from the web browser.

::: tip
This module will take an estimated 7 - 9 hours to complete.
