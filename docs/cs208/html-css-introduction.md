# HTML and CSS Introduction

In this module, we will investigate basic website structure and be using
HTML and CSS concepts. We will learn how to build simple static websites
and style our HTML using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a fundamental building block of the
web. When HTML was first invented it was very simple. However, the
modern web has added a lot of complexity to the standard. For example,
the current HTML living standard PDF is (as of 2021) 1298 pages long!
Compare that to the current (as of 2021) C++ standard PDF at 1448 pages
long. C++ is a turing-complete programming language and HTML is only a
markup language. Even if you have extensive experience in HTML take some
time to dive deep into the standard because there is always something
you can learn üòÅ.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a textual language for describing how a
web page is styled for visual presentation. Before CSS was invented it
was common for web developers to use the `<table>` tag to layout
websites. CSS is now the de facto standard for adding style to your
pages. Check out the [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) for
a demonstration on the power that modern CSS has!
