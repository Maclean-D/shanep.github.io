# Relational Databases and SQL

Applications often need to store and retrieve large amounts of information.
Relational databases have been popular for storing data since the 1970s due to
the relative simplicity and efficiency that relational databases offer.

A relational database stores data about entities. An entity is any object that
an application wants to store information about. E.g., A university database may
need to store data about students, faculty, and course entities.
