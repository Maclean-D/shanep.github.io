# Project 5

![UYNoWork](./images/yunowork.jpeg)

## Overview

In this lab, you are tasked with taking an existing data structure that
is not thread safe and wrapping it to use in a multi-threaded
environment. In industry you may be tasked with modifying legacy code to
work in a multi-threaded environment so this is a critical skill to
master while in school ðŸ˜ƒ.

You are given an existing implementation of merge sort. This
implementation is derived directly from the book "Introduction to
Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein. Your job is to wrap
this algorithm so you can use it in a multi-threaded environment.

## Learning Outcomes

- 1.4 Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to
    produce computing-based solutions. **(ABET Outcome 6)**
- 1.5 Use simple shell scripts and system tools to analyze process behavior
- 3.1 Analyze a complex computing problem and apply principles of
    computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.
    **(ABET Outcome 1)**
- 3 Construct applications that utilize processes, threads, and
    synchronization primitives to solve problems requiring concurrent or
    parallel computation
- 3.2 Explore the effects of multiple threads operating on the same
    buffer

## Grading Rubric

Make sure and review the class [grading rubric](grading-rubric.md) so you know how your project will
be graded.

<!--@include: ../../../parts/project-setup-boiler.md -->

## Task 2 - Prepare your repository

The starter repository is a bare bones template that you will need to update with the starter code
below.

### src/lab.h

<<< @/code/452/p5/lab.h{c}

### app/main.c

<<< @/code/452/p5/main.c

### app/main.c

<<< @/code/452/p5/lab.c

### tests/test-lab.c

<<< @/code/452/p5/test-lab.c

Once you have updated all the starter code lets make your first commit so everything is saved. Open
up a terminal and lets make a commit!

```bash
git add --all
git commit -m "Added in starter code"
```

## Task 3 - Make Thread safe (ABET Outcome 6)

Read through the files `src/lab.h` and `src/lab.cpp` in the project to make sure
you understand the algorithm. You are not allowed to modify the single
threaded implementation in you must implement the function
`mergesort_mt`. Your implementation needs to split up the array into
equal chunks and then hand each chunk to a new thread. You will then use
`pthread_join` to wait for all the chucks to be sorted at which point
you will need to merge the results together. You will not need to use
locks for this approach because you are taking a large array and
splitting it up between threads so each thread only operates on its
section of the larger array. C pointers come in really handy for this
approach because you can keep the original array in place and just
declare new pointers into separate chunks of the existing array.

- [pthread tutorial](https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/pthreads/)
- [Intro to Threads](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/threads-intro.pdf)
- [Threads API](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/threads-api.pdf)

## Task 4 - Driver app

Once you have completed writing the multi-threaded version of the code
you will need to test your code with a simple command line driver that
will take two command line arguments and output the number of threads
used and the total time to sort the array as shown in the example below.
You should see a speed up when you increase the number of threads used
to sort the array. However, if you add too many threads you will see a
slow down because of the overhead of context switching between threads.
You will need to experiment with the number of threads to see what the
optimal number is for your machine and document that in your
Retrospective.md file.

```c
usage: ./myprogram <array_size> <num_threads>
$ ./myprogram 1000 2
0.0820312 2
$ ./myprogram 1000 3
0.104004 3
```

## Task 5 - Add bash files

Below is an example bash script and a gnuplot macro file that you will
need to use to generate a nice plot showing the speedup when using
multiple threads. You will need to install
[gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) on your machine to complete this
task. The lab machines in the CS department already have gnuplot
installed. You can install gnuplot on codespaces using
`sudo apt-get install -y gnuplot`.

You will need to modify the script to use in your project! The script
will **NOT** work as is. Part of this project is to learn how to modify
scripts to automate tasks.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#NOTE!!! THIS WILL NOT WORK IF YOU JUST COPY AND PASTE IT INTO YOUR PROJECT
#YOU WILL NEED TO MODIFY IT TO WORK WITH YOUR PROJECT
function usage() {
    echo "$0 usage:" && grep " .)\ #" $0
    exit 0
}
[ $# -eq 0 ] && usage
while getopts "hs:f:" arg; do
    case $arg in
    s) # The size of the array to sort.
        size=${OPTARG}
        ;;
    f) # The plot file name
        name=${OPTARG}
        ;;
    h | *) # Display help.
        usage
        exit 0
        ;;
    esac
done
if [ "$name" == "" ] || [ "$size" == "" ]
then
        usage
        exit 0
fi
if [ -e ./build/myprogram ]; then
    if [ -e "data.dat" ]; then
        rm -f data.dat
    fi
    echo "Running myprogram to generate data"
    echo "#Time Threads" >> data.dat
    for n in {1..32}; do
        echo -ne "running $n thread \r"
        ./build/myprogram "$size" "$n" >> data.dat
    done
    gnuplot -e "filename='$name.png'" graph.plt
    echo "Created plot $name.png from data.dat file"
else
    echo "myprogram is not present in the build directory. Did you compile your code?"
fi
```

```text
# Gnuplot script file for plotting data in file "data.dat"
set   autoscale                        # scale axes automatically
unset log                              # remove any log-scaling
unset label                            # remove any previous labels
set title "Time to sort vs number of threads"
set xlabel "Time to sort (milliseconds)"
set ylabel "Number of Threads"
set style data linespoints
set term png
set output filename
plot "data.dat" t "time to sort"
```

Assuming that you named your script `createplot.sh` and the gnuplot file
`graph.plt` you can now generate your plot as follows:

```bash
$ ./createplot.sh -s 10000000 -f student_plot
Running myprogram to generate data
Created plot student_plot.png from data.dat file
```

After the script finishes you should see a new file named
`student_plot.png`. We can see in the example below the optimum number
of threads is 9 on my M1 Mac. Your results will vary depending on your
hardware and current system load.

## Task 6 - Complete the Analysis (ABET Outcome 1)

Once you have completed all the tasks craete a file named **Analysis.md**
and add a new section named **\## Analysis** to the bottom of the
document. In this section you will need to include your graph as an
image so it will display when viewed on github.com. You will then need
to talk about your results. Your discussion should be at least 500
words.

- Were you able to generate something close to what the example showed? Why or why not.
- Did you see a slow down at some point why or why not?
- Did your program run faster and faster when you added more threads? Why or why not?
- What was the optimum number of threads for your machine?
- What was the slowest number of threads for your machine?

If your graph does not look like the example graph you will need to
explain why, maybe go back and look at your original implementation, did
you make a mistake somewhere? If you found a bug in your original
implementation please note that and explain what you fixed ðŸ˜ƒ.

## Additional Resources

When you are working on multi-threaded programs it is pretty easy to get
into a deadlocked scenario. Debugging multi-threaded programs can be
difficult because running your program under the debugger can change the
timing of your code and thus make the issue go away. So sometimes the
only way to see where your program is stuck is to attach a debugger post
mortem and dump out the threads.

So assuming you have a program that you ran and it is currently stuck
somewhere here are the steps to at least see where it is stuck which can
help you fix the issue!

### Get the PID of the process

Before you attach a debugger you want to confirm that your program is
completely stopped and you want to get the pid of the program so you can
attach to it. Open up a second terminal and run the command `ps ux` and
look for your program. If you canâ€™t find your program you can try
`ps aux` which will output all users. If you still cant find it make
sure that your program hasnâ€™t exited. **NOTE:** You can not attach to
another users program unless you have access to the root account, you
can only attach to your programs.

In the example below you can see the program
`./mylab -c 3 -p 8 -i 100 -s 5` with PID **254167** is what we want to
debug.

```c
$ ps ux
USER        PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
shanepa+  46764  0.0  0.0 1178788    0 ?        S     2020   0:00 /bin/bash
shanepa+ 129368  0.0  0.0 182776  2632 ?        S    10:02   0:01 sshd: shanepanter@pts/32
shanepa+ 129377  0.0  0.0 127848  3864 pts/32   Ss   10:02   0:02 -bash
shanepa+ 154093  0.0  0.0 1178792    0 ?        S     2020   0:00 /bin/bash
shanepa+ 240623  0.0  0.0 1178788    0 ?        S     2020   0:00 /bin/bash
shanepa+ 254167  0.1  0.0 590304   828 pts/32   Sl+  11:36   0:00 ./mylab -c 3 -p 8 -i 100 -s 5
shanepa+ 254357  0.0  0.0 182776  2472 ?        S    11:36   0:00 sshd: shanepanter@pts/6
shanepa+ 254358  0.5  0.0 127716  3536 pts/6    Ss   11:36   0:00 -bash
shanepa+ 254514  0.0  0.0 166156  2392 pts/6    R+   11:36   0:00 ps ux
```

### Attach to the process

In the same terminal that you ran the `ps ux` command start gdb and
attach to the process with the PID that you found in step 1. Once you
have attached to the process issue the command `thread apply all bt`
where `bt` stands for backtrace applied to all the current threads.

The example below shows that we have 4 threads. Thread 1 is the main
thread and we can see that it is waiting on a `pthread_join` which is
expected so we donâ€™t need to worry about Thread 1. Thread 2, 3, and 4
are all blocked on a condition variable and we can see in the stack
trace they are all stuck in the `dequeue` function.

### Debug it

Now that we at least know **where** our process is stuck we can exam the
code and come up with all the ways that this scenario could occur. Be
aware that the issue may not be in the `dequeue` function! More likely
than not the bug is somewhere else entirely. All this does is give you
some insight into where your program is getting stuck **NOT** where the
problem is!
