# GitHub

GitHub is a web-based platform that provides a variety of services for software
development. It is a popular platform for hosting open-source projects and is
widely used in the software development industry. GitHub provides a number of
features that make it easy to collaborate on projects, track changes to code,
and manage software development workflows. Below are some cool features that
GitHub provides that you can use in your projects.

## GitHub Student Developer Pack

Students can get a free [Github Pro](https://education.github.com/pack) account
as long as you sign up with your Boise State email address. This will allow you
to use Github Codespaces and other cool services for free in all your classes.
If you run out of free hours on codespaces you can use the CS department lab
machines to complete all projects. You **never** have to pay for GitHub, all
assignments can be completed with the free tier or in the CS Labs.

As a student you can get access to a free GitHub Pro account as well as other
really cool features such as GitHub Copilot and GitHub Codespaces.

Be aware that there are some professors in the CS department who view using A.I.
technologies such as Copilot as cheating. So please carefully read the syllabus
in all your classes and look for their policy regarding using A.I. tools.
