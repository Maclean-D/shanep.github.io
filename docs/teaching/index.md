## Challenging a Course

I offer course challenges for the courses listed below. I do not provide any other study materials,
example tests, or example portfolio's beyond what is posted on this website. A portfolio of work
typically means significant contributors to an open source project. You are responsible for
constructing your own portfolio that demonstrates you have met all the learning objectives detailed
in the respective syllabus.

::: info
All exams are closed book, closed notes, closed internet.
