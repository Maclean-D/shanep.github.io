## Challenging a Course

I offer course challenges for the courses listed below. I do not provide any
other study materials, example tests, or example portfolio's beyond what is
posted on this website. A portfolio of work typically means significant
contributors to an open source project. You are responsible for constructing
your own portfolio that demonstrates you have met all the **learning
objectives** detailed in the respective syllabus. If you don't know what to put
in your portfolio you probably aren't ready to challenge the course.

- [CS117](../cs117/index.md) - C++ for Engineers (exam)
- [CS155](../cs155/index.md) - Introduction to Version Control (exam)
- [CS208](../cs208/index.md) - Introduction to Full Stack Web Development (exam)
- [CS452](../cs452/index.md) - Operating Systems (portfolio)

::: info

All exams are closed book, closed notes, closed internet and are proctored. You
will have 1 hour to complete the exam. You must score at least 70% to pass the
exam. All exams must be done in person at Boise State University.

If you would like to proceed with a course challenge please review the
[guidelines](https://www.boisestate.edu/registrar/transfers/prior-learning-credit/course-challenge/)
and then fill out the [challenge
form](https://www.boisestate.edu/registrar/wp-content/uploads/sites/268/2023/05/Credit-for-Prior-Learning-4.pdf)
and turn it into the front office. Once the form is filled out I will contact you to setup a time
and place to take the exam or evaluate your portfolio.

Challenge exams must be **scheduled** during the first week of the spring or
fall semester. You must have the form turned in, and all fees paid by the end of
the first week of the semester to sit for the exam in the same semester
otherwise you will be schedule to take the exam during the first week of the
following semester. Exams are scheduled on a first come first serve basis and
are only offered during the spring and fall semesters. No exams are offered over
Thanksgiving, winter, spring or summer breaks.

::: warning

If you somehow manage to obtain access to the course canvas page or other
materials beyond what is posted on this website before the exam you will be
disqualified from taking the exam and will reported for academic dishonesty.
